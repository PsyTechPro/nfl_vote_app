# NFL Vote App
The NFL Vote App is a simple Python-based application designed to allow users to choose who they think is the best team in the history of the NFL. This is the first web app I've ever created (Dec. 6, 2024), and it was built to engage users by enabling them to cast votes, analyze trends, and visualize results in real time.
